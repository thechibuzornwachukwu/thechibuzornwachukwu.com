This project, being my capstone, implements a hybrid Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that combines FAISS-based vector search and TF-IDF keyword retrieval, followed by cross-encoder re-ranking and T5-based answer generation. The system is evaluated for adversarial robustness using NLP-based perturbation attacks, visualized through a Gradio interface.

So far, I have:
+ Developed a full-stack RAG pipeline integrating vector search (FAISS), sparse keyword search (TF-IDF), and reranking via a cross-encoder for high-precision document retrieval.
+ Designed and deployed an answer generation layer using the FLAN-T5 model, optimized for low-resource environments.
+ Implemented adversarial testing using NLP augmentation (e.g., synonym substitution, word deletion) to assess model robustness under prompt perturbation.
+ Engineered a custom evaluation metric (Adversarial Risk Index) and multi-metric similarity scoring system (cosine, sequence alignment) for semantic integrity tracking.
+ Built an interactive Gradio interface for live testing and visual comparison of normal vs. adversarial responses.
+ Delivered the solution as a modular Python package with a CLI, automated conversion utilities, and GitHub-ready deployment structure.

This report provides a comprehensive analysis of the sharp rise in food prices and inflation in Nigeria. With a focus on exchange rate volatility and the cost of essential commodities, the time period considered was between April, 2023 and April, 2024.

Over the past year, Nigeria has witnessed unprecedented increases in food prices, exacerbated by currency depreciation, supply chain disruptions, and economic instability. 

Leveraging data from Nigerian Bureau of Statistics and Nigeria Data Portal, I used PowerBI, MsExcel and Python to provide a detailed understanding of the inflationary pressure on food prices. After extracting insights, I added recommendations with hopes to ease the burdens on citizens.

Aug 2024 - Aug 2024Aug 2024 - Aug 2024
The objective of this analysis is to extract actionable insights that can form a body of knowledge for informed decision making, to greatly improve sales, increase revenue and boost operations.

The data assessed consists of over thirty-one thousand transactions (31k) worth a total seventy-three billion naira (₦73bn) carried out between January 03, 2014, and June 30, 2015. What follows is a quick overview of the data: 9 product models sold, 2.37M avg revenue generated, 742K total units sold. 

Besides the summary, here are 7 key insights I extracted from the data:
o The best date for both revenue and sales was 28 February 2014, with revenue exceeding ₦353 million and an average of ₦3.3 million per transaction. This could not be a mere occurrence, as it repeated itself the next year; between 26-27 February 2015.
o Customers spend more on Workdays, with total revenue of ₦69 million and an average spend of over ₦2.3 million per transaction.
o Northern regions dominate in terms of the number of transactions and total revenue.
o The most profitable products are 3002P and 4500C, each yielding high returns north of ₦24 billion and ₦15 billion respectively, the two products together generate over 25% of all income and sales
o Ekiti generates ₦5.6 billion in revenue, with Ekiti Southwest alone contributing ₦1.2 billion (> 21%). Abia follows closely with ₦5.0 billion, where Arochukwu accounts for ₦1.4 billion (> 28%).
o The best-performing store is in Ajaokuta, known for its focus on Printers, generating ₦6.3 million in revenue, significantly outperforming other stores in the same market and region.
o Parts is the most common line of business, while Service Plan generates the highest revenue on average, with ₦4.2 million per transaction and a total of ₦52 million.

For the Maven Rail Challenge, I played the role of a BI Developer for National Rail, a company that provides business services to passenger train operators in England, Scotland, and Wales.

The objectives were somewhat laid out:
- Identify the most popular routes
- Determine peak travel times
- Analyze revenue from different ticket types & classes
- Diagnose on-time performance and contributing factors.

I approached with enough research about the domain and made sure to simplify the visuals for the prospective stakeholders.

Although many Christian movies and books are available, it can be difficult to find ones that are both entertaining and inspiring as well as correlating to a verse. This project aims to develop a recommendation system that can suggest Christian movies and books that are tailored to scriptural references.

Objectives:
- Collect data with predominantly Christian content
- Clean and preprocess the data
- Use cosine similarity to measure the similarity between different verses, movies and books.
- Develop a user interface that allows users to easily browse and search for recommendations.
- Deploy the recommendation system to a web server so that it can be accessed by users from anywhere in the world.
